# gcloud-ctx (gctx)

[![Build and Test](https://github.com/adamrodger/gcloud-ctx/workflows/Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adamrodger/gcloud-ctx/actions)
[![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/adamrodger/gcloud-ctx)](https://github.com/adamrodger/gcloud-ctx/releases/latest)

A fast replacement for [`gcloud config configurations`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/config/configurations)
written in Rust for managing [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) `gcloud` configurations easily and quickly

**Note**: This project is independent and not afilliated with Google in any way

## Installation

### Windows

Install via [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh):

```bash
scoop bucket add adamrodger https://github.com/adamrodger/scoop-bucket
scoop install gctx
```

### Pre-Built Binaries (Windows, Linux, Mac)

Grab the [latest binary](https://github.com/adamrodger/gcloud-ctx/releases/latest), extract it and add it to your `PATH`.

### From Source

Get the latest stable version of Rust via [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) and run:

```bash
cargo install gctx
```

### Others (e.g. `winget`, `brew`, `apt-get`, `aur`)

**TODO**: [Support for `brew`](https://github.com/adamrodger/gcloud-ctx/issues/14)

## Usage

```bash
## show the current configuration (useful for adding to default prompt)
gctx current
gctx          # shorthand, just omit current

## list all configurations
gctx list

## activate a different configuration
gctx my-config
gctx activate my-config   # explicitly activate, e.g. if your configuration name clashes with a gctx command
gctx activate             # if fzf is installed, you can omit the name and select from a list

## create (and optionally activate) a new configuration
gctx create my-config --project foo \
                      --account a.user@example.org \
                      --zone europe-west1-d \
                      --region europe-west1 \
                      --force \
                      --activate

## copy an existing configuration
gctx copy src-name dest-name --force --activate

## show the properties of a configuration (like gcloud config configurations describe)
gctx describe           # defaults to the current configuration
gctx describe name      # describe a named configuration

## rename a configuration
gctx rename old-name new-name
gctx rename --force old-name existing-name   # use force to overwrite an existing configuration

## delete a configuration. note: you can't delete the active configuration
gctx delete my-config

## show help and usage
gctx --help
```

## Motivation

I'm often working with multiple GCP projects with a variety of different settings (e.g. default compute zone).However,
the standard `gcloud` tool has two major problems:

- It's quite a lot of typing if you're switching often. Sure, an alias can help, but...
- `gcloud` is slow to initialise which makes it annoying to use and to add to your default prompt

After having used [`kubectx`](https://github.com/ahmetb/kubectx) to solve a similar problem switching between
Kubernetes contexts easily, I searched for a similar tool that could easily switch between `gcloud` configurations
but couldn't find anything. So, having spent a while learning [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and being incredibly
impressed, I thought it would make a great starter project.

## Goals

`gctx` aims to achieve similar goals to `kubectx`, such as:

- Extremely fast switching between different `gcloud` configurations
- Cross platform
- Shorter to type than `gcloud config configurations activate` ðŸ˜„
- Fuzzy finding using `fzf` (if installed)

## License

`gctx` is distributed under the terms of the MIT license

## Previous `gctx` crate

Note that versions prior to 0.3.0 of the `gctx` crate are unrelated works by a previous author
that were yanked and abandoned. The previous author kindly passed the crate name over to me so
that I can reuse it. Thank you again!
